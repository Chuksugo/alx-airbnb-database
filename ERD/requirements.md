# ERD Requirements for ALX Airbnb Database Project

## Overview

This document outlines the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Airbnb-like database project. The ERD was designed to model core components of a rental platform such as users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. It captures the essential entities, attributes, and relationships needed to support the application's functionality.

### 2. Property
- `property_id` (PK)
- `host_id` (FK ‚Üí User)
- `name`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

### 3. Booking

### 4. Payment
